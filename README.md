We chose a classic that ties back to Asteroids which came out in 1979. I picked it because the game captures the simple thrill of flying a small ship while dodging and shooting rocks. The rules are easy to explain and fun to play.  This classic also connects players to the early days of arcade culture and shows how small mechanics can make big feelings. Using Asteroids as a reference lets me add a retro mini game that is interactive and familiar. It gives the project a clear historical view while still leaving room to add my own twist of asteroid chaos. The result is a game that feels honest, playful, and respectful to the old style while being easy to teach to anyone. It invites players to share memories and start friendly competitions together today.
